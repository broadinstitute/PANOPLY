# ```panoply_parse_sm_table```

## Description

This module extracts useful and relevant data from the output files generated by [Spectrum Mill](https://www.agilent.com/en/products/software-informatics/masshunter-suite/masshunter-for-life-science-research/spectrum-mill) (SM) software. Sample annotations provided in the `exptDesign` file are included (as column annotations) in the output `gct` file, in addition to a collection of useful protein/PTM site-specific information (row annotations) extracted from the input data table.

## Input

Required inputs:

* ```SMtable```: (`.ssv` file) semi-colon separated output table generated by Spectrum Mill
* ```exptDesign```: (`.csv` file) experiment design file; must include `Sample.ID` (unique), `Experiment` (plex number) and `Channel` (TMT channel); additional optional columns that are used in the pipeline include `QC.status` (exclude samples from final table if `QC.status` is not `QC.pass`) and `Participant` (replicates are identified as having the same ID in this column)
* ```analysisDir```: (String) name of analysis directory
* ```type```: (String) proteomics data type (proteome, phosphoproteome, etc)
* ```yaml```: (`.yaml` file) master-parameters.yaml

Optional inputs:

* ```labelType```: (String, default = 'TMT10') type if chemical labeling used for multiplexing in MS proteomics data generation; options are
  - `TMT10` (TMT-10 with 131 channel as common reference)
  - `TMT11` (TMT-11 with 131C channel as common reference) 
  - `TMT10.126` (TMT-10 with 126 channel as common reference)
  - `iTRAQ4` (iTRAQ 4-plex with 117 as common reference)
* ```speciesFilter```: (String, default = TRUE) enable species filtering to retain only human proteins
* ```ndigits```: (Int, default = 5) number of decimal digits to use in output `gct` tables
* ```outFile```: (String, default = "panoply_parse_sm_table-output.tar") output `.tar` file name

## Output

Tarball with the following `.gct` files in the `parsed-data` subdirectory:

* `*-intensity` report ion intensities (for channels with samples) for each protein/PTM site
* `*-num-ratio` number of PSM ratios observed for each protein/PTM site
* `*-num-spectra` number of spectra observed for each protein/PTM site
* `*-precursor-intensity` precursor ion intensity for each protein/PTM site
* `*-ratio` log2 ratio to common reference for each protein/PTM site
* `*-reference-intensity` reporter ion intensity of the common reference channel for each protein/PTM site
* `*-unique-peptides` unique peptide count for each protein/PTM site
