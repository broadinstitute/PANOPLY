# ```panoply_normalize_ms_data```

## Description

This module normalizes and filters proteomics (protein/PTM site) data. The normalization methods, especially two-component normalization, assume that the input data are log ratios to a common reference. 

Normalization methods available are:

* Z-scoring (`mean`): mean-centering followed by standard deviation scaling
* Median-MAD normalization (`median`): median-centering followed by median absolute deviation (MAD) scaling
* Two-component mixture model-based normalization (`2comp`): In this method, we assume that for every sample there is a set of unregulated proteins or PTM sites. In the normalized sample, these proteins or PTM sites should have a log ratio centered at zero. In addition, there are proteins or PTM sites that are either up- or downregulated. This normalization scheme attempts to identify the unregulated proteins or PTM sites, and centers the distribution of these log-ratios around zero in order to nullify the effect of differential protein loading and/or systematic MS variation. A 2-component Gaussian mixture model-based is used to achieve this effect. The two Gaussians N (&mu;<sub>1</sub>, &sigma;<sub>1</sub>) and N (&mu;<sub>2</sub>, &sigma;<sub>2</sub>) for a sample *i* are fitted and used in the normalization process as follows: the mode *m*<sub>i</sub> of the log-ratio distribution is determined for each sample using kernel density estimation with a Gaussian kernel and Shafer-Jones bandwidth. A two-component Gaussian mixture model is then fit with the mean of both Gaussians constrained to be *m*<sub>i</sub>, i.e., &mu;<sub>i1</sub> = &mu;<sub>i2</sub> = *m*<sub>i</sub>. The Gaussian with the smaller estimated standard deviation &sigma;<sub>i</sub> = min (&sigma;<sub>i1</sub> , &sigma;<sub>i2</sub>) is assumed to represent the unregulated component of proteins/PTM sites, and is used to normalize the sample by subtracting the mean *m*<sub>i</sub> from each protein/PTM site and dividing by the standard deviation &sigma;<sub>i</sub>. See (Mertins et al., 2016) and (Gillette et al, 2020).

Normalization is followed by filtering:

* For Spectrum Mill based tables, exclude rows (proteins/PTM sites) with numratio less than `minNumratio` in more than `minNumratioFraction` samples
* If `sdFilterThreshold` is specified, exclude rows with standard deviation less than `sdFilterThreshold`
* If replicates are present in the data (identified by identical `Participant` values in the sample annotation table), combine by taking the mean value across replicates for each row
* Exclude rows with more than `naMax` missing values
* Create an additional table with no missing values
* If the sample annotation table contains a `QC.status` column, samples marked `QC.pass` will be retained in the output files, and additional output files (`*-QC.fail.gct`) will be created with the remaining samples

The module also creates

* Profile plots (density plots) for each sample before and after normalization for comparison.
* Plots of summary of normalizaton statistics.


## Input

Required inputs:

* ```inputData```: (`.tar` file) tarball from ```panoply_parse_sm_table``` or un-normalized input data in `gct` format (when `standalone` is `true`)
* ```type```: (String) proteomics data type
* ```standalone```: (String) set to ```true``` to run as a self-contained module; if ```true``` the ```analysisDir``` input is required
* ```yaml```: (`.yaml` file) parameters in `yaml` format
* ```analysisDir```: (String) name of analysis directory

Optional inputs:

* ```normalizeProteomics```: (String, default chosen in startup notebook) when 'true' normalization and filtering will be applied, when 'false' normalization and filtering are skipped
* ```normMethod```: (String, default = '2comp') normalization method; options are '2comp', 'median', 'mean'
* ```altMethod```: (String, default = 'median') alternate normalization method for comparison with `normMethod`; filtered datasets not generated for the data normalized using `altMethod`
* ```ndigits```: (Int, default = 5) number of decimal digits to use in output tables
* ```naMax```: (Float, default = 0.7) maximum allowed NA values per row (protein/PTM site); can be fraction between 0-1 or an integer specifying actual number of samples
* ```sampleNaMax```: (Float, default = 0.8) maximum allowed fraction of NA values per sample/column; error if violated
* ```applySMfilter```: (String, default = TRUE) flag for applying numRatio based filter. Use TRUE if original input was `.ssv` generated by Spectrum Mill 
* ```minNumratioProteome```: (Int, default = 2 for protome) minimum number of ratios that need to be observed for each protein/PTM site in order to retain in the filtered table (primarily used for Spectrum Mill data)
* ```minNumratioPTMs```: (Int, default = 1 for PTMs) minimum number of ratios that need to be observed for each protein/PTM site in order to retain in the filtered table (primarily used for Spectrum Mill data)
* ```minNumratioFraction```: (Float, default = 0.25) fraction of samples in which `minNumratio` should be present to retain protein/PTM site (primarily used for Spectrum Mill data)
* ```sdFilterThreshold```: (Float, default = 0.5) standard deviation (SD) threshold for SD filtering; rows (proteins/PTM sites) with SD less than `sdFilterThreshold` are excluded from the filtered output table
* ```geneIdCol```: (String, default = 'geneSymbol') name of (row) annotation column containing gene IDs.
* ```outTar```: (String, default = "panoply_normalize_ms_data-output.tar") output `.tar` file name
* ```outTable```: (String, default = "normalized_table-output.gct") output `.gct` normalized/filtered file name

## Output

	* normalized *and* filtered data table (`*-ratio-norm-NArm.gct`)
	* normalized and filtered data, with rows (protein/PTM sites) containing any NA values excluded (`*-ratio-norm-noNA.gct`)
	* normalized data table using alternate normalization method specified in `altMethod` (`*-ratio-*-norm.gct`)

* Other files
	* Class vector files (`*.cls`) for categorical sample annotations with 2-5 categories
	* Filtered `gct` data tables for samples that do not pass QC, i.e., `QC.status` column (if present) in the sample annotation file is not `QC.pass`
