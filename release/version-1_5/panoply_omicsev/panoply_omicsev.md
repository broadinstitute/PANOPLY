# `panoply_omicsev`

### Description

A tool for large scale omics data tables evaluation. Find full OmicsEV documentation [here](https://github.com/bzhanglab/OmicsEV).

### Mandatory Inputs

**General mandatory inputs:**

-   `STANDALONE` (String): Either `"true"` or `"false"`. Determines whether OmicsEV should run as part of `panoply_main` pipeline with inputs from `panoply_harmonize`, or if OmicsEV should run independently with .gct inputs. Preference is to run with `STANDALONE == "false"` if possible.
-   `yaml_file` (File): Parameters yaml file from PANOPLY setup. Must contain gene.id.col, groups information, an defaults for OmicsEV parameters.
-   `label` (String): Label for this data set (e.g. "BRCA.proteome"). HTML report will include this label in the file name.

**Mandatory inputs if `STANDALONE = "false"`:**

-   `panoply_harmonize_tar` (File): Tar output from panoply_harmonize module.
-   `ome_type` (String): The PANOPLY omics type of the input (e.g. `"proteome"`).

**Mandatory inputs if `STANDALONE = "true"`:**

-   `data_files` (Array[File]): Array of .gct files to be used for OmicsEV. These are typically all the same -ome from the same samples with some variation in how abundance values were calculated. For example, multiple proteome files generated using different batch correction methods. Array[File] format is `["/path/to/file-1.gct","/path/to/file-2.gct","/path/to/file-3.gct"]`. *Make sure there is no space between each file, just a single comma*. A single data file input is acceptable (e.g. `["/path/to/file-1.gct"]`).
-   `sample_anno_file` (File): A .csv file with sample annotations. File must include same samples as are in `data_files`. This file must have columns labeled with `class_column_name` and `batch_column_name` (or their PANOPLY defaults, see below).

### Optional Inputs

**General optional inputs:**

-   `class_column_name` (String): Column in sample annotation file that contains class information. This should be a categorical annotation (e.g. sex, cancer type, etc.) to assess differences between phenotypes. The default in the PANOPLY yaml file is `"Type"`. *If `class_column_name` is not found in the sample annotation file, the default behavior is to include all samples in an artificial class called "Default".*
-   `batch_column_name` (String): Column in sample annotation file that contains batch information. This is used to assess batch effects. Must be integer values with no NA's. If `STANDALONE = true`, this can also be a column in the column-description of each .gct file in `data_files`. The default in the PANOPLY yaml file is `"Experiment"`, which is found in outputs from SpectrumMill. *If `batch_column_name` is not found in the sample annotation file, the default behavior is to include all samples in an artificial batch (batch = 1).*
-   `data_log_transformed` (Boolean): Indicates whether the protein-level data has been log transformed.
-   `rna_log_transformed` (Boolean): Indicates whether the rna data has been log transformed.
-   `do_function_prediction` (Boolean): Whether or not to perform gene function prediction analysis. If this is not necessary, it is suggested to turn this off. Gene function prediction takes a considerable amount of time. Default in PANOPLY yaml file is `false`.

**Optional inputs if `STANDALONE = true`:**

-   `rna_file` (File): A .gct file of RNAseq data. Used only for RNA-protein correlation at the end of OmicsEV.
-   `data_type` (String): Either "protein" or "gene". Describes the data type of `data_files`. Default is "protein".

### Output

-   `report` (File): An HTML report of OmicsEV evaluation metrics for each dataset.
-   `outputs` (File): A tarball with the full OmicsEV outputs, including intermediary tables and figures.
