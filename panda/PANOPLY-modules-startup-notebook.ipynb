    "# PANOPLY Startup Notebook<br> for running individual analysis modules\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an easy-to-use interface to configure a Terra Workspace to run PANOPLY on proteogenomics data. <br>\n",
    "**Click the `OPEN` button above** and follow these step-by-step instructions to get started. \n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "### Using this Notebook\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start the **Notebook Runtime** with the `gcr.io/broadcptac/panda:1_3` docker.  \n",
    "> - Click on the Notebook settings (cog-wheel) at the top right. Use the `ENVIRONMENT` pull down and choose `Custom Environment`. Enter `gcr.io/broadcptac/panda:1_3` into the `CONTAINER IMAGE` text box. Customize `COMPUTE POWER` as needed, and click `CREATE` or `UPDATE`.\n",
    "2. You can run this notebook multiple times.  \n",
    "> - The first execution should run all code blocks (except the optional **Color Schemes** section). \n",
    "> - Subsequent executions will retain original settings, which can be modified as needed (by running appropriate code blocks), including creating new sample subsets.\n",
    " \n",
    "3. To run a code block, click on it, and either choose `Cell -> Run Cells` or hit `Shift-ENTER`. Running the entire notebook is not recommended since many code blocks require user input. Carefully read each section, and then run the associated code block.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this notebook results in:\n",
    "* Creating/updating a `config.yaml` configuration file that captures your choices made by running this notebook. If this configuration file is already present (i.e., notebook was already run previsouly), those choices will be reused, and can be optionally modified.\n",
    "* Uploading input data to the Terra Workspace bucket.\n",
    "* Creating data subsets, if specified. A default subset `all` including all samples is always created. \n",
    "* Configuring parameters and metadata tables in the Terra Workspace to enable single-click execution of PANOPLY workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare Data\n",
    "You will need the following data tables to run PANOPLY:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Required:\n",
    "* At least **one dataset**: either proteomics (global proteome, phosphoproteome, acetylome, ubiquitylome--after database searching and quantification) or genomics (RNA, CNA--normalized and filtered as needed) data;\n",
    "* `Annotation` table with at least `Sample.ID` and `Type` columns, in addition to an arbitrary number of annotations for the samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Optional:\n",
    "* A `groups` file that lists a subset of annotations (one per line) to be used for association and enrichment analysis;\n",
    "* A default `parameter` file is used, unless one is specified in the input (in `yaml` format);\n",
    "* Pathway databases for PTM-SEA (PTM-SigDB v1.9.0) and GSEA (v6.2 hallmark pathways) are automatically included, and can be over-ridden by providing appropriate `gmt` input files.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Formats:\n",
    "`Annotation` and `groups` tables must be in `csv` format. The `Annotation` table must include a `Sample.ID` column. `Sample.ID`s must be unique and cannot have duplicates. If a `groups` file is not specified in the input, one can be interactively created using the annotations present in the `annotation` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "All proteomics and genomics data tables must be in [GCT v1.3 format](https://clue.io/connectopedia/gct_format), with sample ids (column names) conforming to the `Sample.ID`s used in the `annotation` table. Ideally, the sample annotations included in the `annotation` table would be present in the GCT v1.3 data files as column annotations. See [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/PANOPLY/wiki) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "All genomics data tables must be appropriately normalized/filtered prior to use in PANOPLY. Proteomics data can be optionally normalized/filtered in PANOPLY.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continue** by reading the descriptions and requirements, and running appropriate code blocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialize Notebook\n",
    "Start by running the initialization code block below."
